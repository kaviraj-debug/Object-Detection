🚀 Object Detection & Tracking System
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time Object Detection and Tracking system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It detects multiple objects in video streams and assigns unique IDs to track them consistently across frames.

The system is designed to handle real-world scenarios such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and smart vision applications.

🎯 Features
▶ Real-time object detection

▶ Multi-object tracking with unique IDs

▶ Smooth tracking across video frames

▶ Supports video files and live webcam input

▶ Efficient and accurate performance

🧠 Technologies Used
▶ Python

▶ OpenCV

▶ Deep Learning (YOLO / CNN-based model)

▶ Object Tracking Algorithms (e.g., SORT / DeepSORT)

⚙️ How It Works
▶ Video frames are captured from a camera or video file

▶ A deep learning model detects objects in each frame

▶ Bounding boxes and confidence scores are generated

▶ A tracking algorithm assigns and maintains object IDs

▶ Objects are tracked continuously across frames

📸 Sample Output
Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and unique tracking IDs in real time.

🚀 Future Improvements
▶ Improve tracking accuracy

▶ Add object counting and analytics

▶ Optimize performance for edge devices

▶ Deploy as a web application
